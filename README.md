A full-stack e-commerce web application built with **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. This project allows users to browse products, manage categories, and perform authentication, with a fully functional admin panel.

## My Journey

Building this project was a real challenge, but an incredible learning experience ðŸ’ª.  

I faced issues with:

- Connecting frontend and backend in a deployed environment
- Handling CORS errors between Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)
- Managing environment variables for both local and production deployments
- Debugging and making the app fully functional

After several iterations, debugging, and learning deployment intricacies, I finally got everything running smoothly. This project strengthened my skills in **React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, deployment**, and **real-world problem-solving**.
